Dive deeper into the capabilities of the LoLLMs Client JS library ðŸŒŒ, crafted for developers by ParisNeo. This detailed guide will cover the methods provided by the library, including how to use them and their parameters, to empower your applications with cutting-edge AI text generation.

## Installation

Ensure you have Node.js installed, then add LoLLMs Client JS to your project:

```bash
npm install lollms_client_js
```

## Initialization

Start by importing and initializing the `LollmsClient`:

```javascript
const LollmsClient = require('lollms_client_js');

// Initialize the client with your LoLLMs host and the model name.
const client = new LollmsClient('http://your-lollms-host.com', 'modelName');
```

### Methods Overview

The `LollmsClient` provides several methods for interacting with the LoLLMs backend:

- `generateText()`
- `generate_completion()`
- `listMountedPersonalities()`
- `listModels()`

### `generateText(prompt, options)`

Generates text based on a given prompt and options.

**Parameters:**

- `prompt` (String): The input text to generate further content.
- `options` (Object): Optional parameters to customize the request. Includes:
  - `stream` (Boolean): Whether to stream the response.
  - `temperature` (Number): Controls randomness.
  - `topK` (Number): Filters the top K candidates before sampling.
  - `topP` (Number): Nucleus sampling.
  - `repeatPenalty` (Number): Penalty for repetition.
  - `repeatLastN` (Number): Number of tokens to check for repetition.
  - `seed` (Number): Random seed for reproducibility.
  - `nThreads` (Number): Number of threads to use.

**Example:**

```javascript
client.generateText("Hi there, how can I assist you today?", { temperature: 0.9 }).then(response => {
  console.log(response);
});
```

### `generate_completion(prompt, options)`

Generates a completion for a given prompt with detailed control over the generation process.

**Parameters:**

Similar to `generateText`, but with an additional `completionFormat` parameter to specify the format of the generated completion.

**Example:**

```javascript
client.generate_completion("The future of AI in robotics is", { temperature: 0.7, completionFormat: "vllm instruct" }).then(completion => {
  console.log(completion);
});
```

### `listMountedPersonalities()`

Lists all mounted personalities available on the LoLLMs server.

**Example:**

```javascript
client.listMountedPersonalities().then(personalities => {
  console.log(personalities);
});
```

### `listModels()`

Lists all models available for text generation on the LoLLMs server.

**Example:**

```javascript
client.listModels().then(models => {
  console.log(models);
});
```
